That's right: From Monday, September 30 to Sunday, October 6, the Portland Mercury's Wing Week returns with one-of-a-kind chicken wings available at some of Portland's favorite bars and restaurants! Even better? Each order of wings will only cost you a mere $8!\nAlso, Wing Fanatics - our sponsor Rose City Rollers is hosting the roller derby global championships in November and will be giving away swag and tickets during wing week at select locations. See below for all the details!\nRose City Rollers has partnered up with Gigantic Brewing to release another beer in their Weird Portland collection- the RCR Power Jam Pale Ale! This pale ale is described as the ultimate crusher for superfans in the stands at The Hangar and skaters cooling down after a bout. Crisp, refreshing, and perfectly hoppy—grab one and let the good vibes roll! Roller derby skaters from RCR will be making their way across town during Wing Week, rolling (literally) through participating Wing Week locations that are carrying the beer to hand out free merch, stickers, handbills, and if you're lucky (or spotted drinking the RCR beer)- free tickets to 2024 WFTDA Global Championships Nov 1-3 at VMC, hosted by Rose City Rollers!",

Roller derby skaters from RCR will be making their way across town during Wing Week, rolling (literally) through participating Wing Week locations that are carrying the beer to hand out free merch, stickers, handbills, and if you're lucky (or spotted drinking the RCR beer)- free tickets to 2024 WFTDA Global Championships Nov 1-3 at VMC, hosted by Rose City Rollers!\n                    \n                    \n                \n                    THE MAP\n\nTHE WINGS\nSee Vegetarian/Vegan & Gluten-Free Options",
